# About
This is a simple todo app that supports task lists, drag & drop and some other things.
Tasks can be created, edited, marked completed and deleted.
Task lists also can be deleted, created and edited. In the panel on the left, the list is marked completed if all of its tasks are marked as completed. 

Each task exists in its own separate task list. In turn, each user has their own task lists.

This app includes three-tier architecture (data access layer, common layer and layer of Android application). Also, task lists supports drag & drop, which you can change position of task (just visually for now), or delete task by swipe to right. When you swiped, you can undone deleting your task by "undo" button on snackbar.
